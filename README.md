# üíµ Payment Manager

## üî≠ Overview

The **Payment Manager** is a payment management system built using **Java 21**, **Spring Boot**, and various modern technologies. This application allows users to authenticate and manage their sales, keeping track of payment methods and their validity dates. Once a sale's validity period expires, the sale will be marked as unpaid. 

This system is designed to handle multiple payment methods, track the expiration date of each payment, and provide a clean and efficient way to manage all transactions. Each user can manage their own sales, ensuring that they have clear visibility over the payments they need to make.
